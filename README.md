# wifispam

This script allows you to spam thousands of WiFi SSIDs.

Notes

This script allows you to generate the number of SSIDs that you want, unless you're using the default word list (1000 SSIDs).
If you are going to use the 4th option I recommend you generate up to ~5000 SSIDs
Some IntelÂ® Hardware In particular Centrino are known to cause problems becuase of the way mdk3 works.
